RMAN command deleting archivelog files issues a warning instead of deleting the archivelog file:

RMAN-08137: WARNING: archive log not deleted as it is still needed
archive log filename=/<path>/1_3740_580667843.dbf thread=1 sequence=3740

In newer versions, the error may be:
RMAN-08120:WARNING: archived log not deleted, not yet applied by standby

The following query of v$archived_log in the primary, you show at least one archivelog with APPLIED=NO:

alter session set nls_date_format='dd-mon-rr hh24:mi:ss';
select recid, dest_id, thread#, sequence#, first_time, completion_time, creator, registrar, 
archived, applied, deleted, status from v$archived_log where standby_dest='YES' and status='A';


SOLUTION
The solution to this warning is to ensure that all archivelog files are applied to the standby database.  

Check that the standby database is up to date.  I.e., is not behind the primary database.  If it is not, restart managed recovery and resolve any gaps.  Then query the primary's v$archived_log view again for any log sequences which still has applied='NO'.  

If you still have logs with applied='NO' and you are certain that these logs has been applied to the standby and thus there is no 'gap', you can delete these archives in one of two ways:

1.  Using RMAN 'force' option with the last sequence applied to the standby.  I.e.: 

RMAN> delete force archivelog until sequence <last sequence number applied to standby>;
2.  Manually delete the physical archivelog files.  This is not recommended, but if mandatory, be sure that the archivelog files you are deleting have been backed up.  Once the delete is complete, you must run crosscheck 
within RMAN followed by a delete expired to remove RMAN's metadata.  I.e.:  

 

RMAN> crosscheck archivelog all;
RMAN> delete noprompt expired archivelog all;


How to Delete Archivelog Using RMAN in Oracle
Recovery Manager (RMAN) is an Oracle Database client that performs backup and recovery tasks on your databases and automates administration of your backup strategies.

If you want to delete archivelog from FRA(ASM Storage -Flash Revovery Area) or filesystem to free space, you can use the following commands:

 

Start the RMAN executable at the operating system command line while connecting to a target database and, possibly, to a recovery catalog, as in the following examples:

% rman TARGET /       # operating system authentication
% rman TARGET SYS@prod NOCATALOG  # RMAN prompts for SYS password
% rman TARGET / CATALOG rco@catdb # RMAN prompts for rco password
set NLS_DATE_FORMAT=YYYYMMDD HH24:MI:SS
Archivelog List Commands:
list archivelog all; 
list copy of archivelog until time 'SYSDATE-1'; 
list copy of archivelog from time 'SYSDATE-1'; 
list copy of archivelog from time 'SYSDATE-1' until time 'SYSDATE-2'; 
list copy of archivelog from sequence 1000; 
list copy of archivelog until sequence 1500; 
list copy of archivelog from sequence 1000 until sequence 1500; 
Archivelog Delete Commands:
delete archivelog all;
delete archivelog until time 'SYSDATE-1'; 
delete archivelog from time 'SYSDATE-1'; 
delete archivelog from time 'SYSDATE-1' until time 'SYSDATE-2'; 
delete archivelog from sequence 1000; 
delete archivelog until sequence 1500; 
delete archivelog from sequence 1000 until sequence 1500; 
Note : Use noprompt to avoid being prompted for each file

delete noprompt archivelog until time 'SYSDATE-1';
