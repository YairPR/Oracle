Cause
Caused for error is the process did not release the enqueue within the maximum allowed time. General cause of ORA-00494 error is during periods of high utilization of system resources that instance becomes unresponsive due to overloaded disk I/O, CPU or RAM.

When any process holds the CF enqueue for long time, the other processes which need to perform the Controlfile transaction will be waiting to acquire the enqueue. Holding the enqueue for very long time can lead to database hang. Hence there is a timeout set for holding the controlfile enqueue. The timeout is 900 secs (15 min). If the process exceeds this timeout, then the holder process is killed by killing the session of holding process. The waiting process normally kills the holding process which exceeds the timeout. Then the error is logged in the alert log.

Solution
Following hidden parameters may be help in this situation:

Check value of hidden parameters before changing it:

COLUMN ksppinm FORMAT A35
COLUMN ksppstvl FORMAT A10
SELECT ksppinm,ksppstvl
FROM x$ksppi a, x$ksppsv b
WHERE a.indx=b.indx
AND ksppinm in ('_kill_controlfile_enqueue_blocker','_kill_enqueue_blocker','_controlfile_enqueue_timeout') ORDER BY ksppinm;

REPORT THIS AD

_kill_controlfile_enqueue_blocker = { TRUE | FALSE }
Workaround: Disable the parameter

alter system set "_kill_controlfile_enqueue_blocker"=false;

Note:
TRUE: Enables this mechanism and kills blocker process in CF enqueue.(Default value).
FALSE: Disables this mechanism and no blocker process in CF enqueue will be killed.

_kill_enqueue_blocker = { 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 }
Workaround: Set 1 value for this parameter

alter system set "_kill_enqueue_blocker"=1 scope=spfile;

0. Disables this mechanism and no foreground or background blocker process in enqueue will be killed.
1. Enables this mechanism and only kills foreground blocker process in enqueue while background process is not affected.
2. Enables this mechanism and only kills background blocker process in enqueue.
3. Enables this mechanism and kills blocker processes in enqueue.
Note: you can set the following init.ora parameter to 1 (Default value is 3 for 10g and 2 for 11g databases)

_controlfile_enqueue_timeout = { INTEGER }
Workaround: Increase value

ALTER SYSTEM SET "_controlfile_enqueue_timeout"=1800;

Note:
900. Default value.
1800. Optimum value to prevent enqueue timeout.

Rest or remove these parameter:

alter system reset "_kill_controlfile_enqueue_blocker";
alter system reset "_kill_enqueue_blocker";
