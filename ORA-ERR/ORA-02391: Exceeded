ORA-02391: Exceeded Simultaneous SESSIONS_PER_USER Limit

PROBLEM:
While connecting to the database, getting error:

SQL> connect test9/test9
ERROR:
ORA-02391: exceeded simultaneous SESSIONS_PER_USER limit

SOLUTION:
1. Check how many sessions were already existed for that user:

SELECT count(*) as connections,username FROM v$session where username=’&USER_NAME’ GROUP BY username;

 
SQL> SELECT count(*) as connections,username   FROM   v$session where username='&USER_NAME' GROUP  BY username;
Enter value for user_name: TEST9
old   1: SELECT count(*) as connections,username   FROM   v$session where username='&USER_NAME' GROUP  BY username
new   1: SELECT count(*) as connections,username   FROM   v$session where username='TEST9' GROUP  BY username
 
CONNECTIONS USERN
----------- -----
          2 TEST9
 
TEST9 user has currently 2 sessions.

2. Check the value of SESSIONS_PER_USER for this user

col username for a12
col profile for a19
col limit for a12
set lines 299
select a.username,b.PROFILE,b.RESOURCE_NAME,b.limit from dba_users a , dba_profiles b where a.profile=b.profile and b.RESOURCE_NAME=’SESSIONS_PER_USER’ and a.username=’&USER_NAME’;
 
Enter value for user_name: TEST9
old   1: select a.username,b.PROFILE,b.RESOURCE_NAME,b.limit from dba_users a , dba_profiles b where a.profile=b.profile and b.RESOURCE_NAME='SESSIONS_PER_USER' and a.username='&USER_NAME'
new   1: select a.username,b.PROFILE,b.RESOURCE_NAME,b.limit from dba_users a , dba_profiles b where a.profile=b.profile and b.RESOURCE_NAME='SESSIONS_PER_USER' and a.username='TEST9'
 
USERNAME     PROFILE             RESOURCE_NAME                    LIMIT
------------ ------------------- -------------------------------- ------------
TEST9        TEST                SESSIONS_PER_USER                2
 
We can see, the sessions_per_user allowed for this users in 2. To fix this user, increase the limit for SESSIONS_PER_USER in the profile.

Here the profile for the user is TEST

3. Alter the profile with higher SESSIONS_PER_USER value.

 
 
SQL> ALTER PROFILE TEST LIMIT SESSIONS_PER_USER 10;
 
Profile altered.
 
Now try to connect with the user.
