How to Convert PPK to PEM File using Command

One of my clients provided me .ppk file to connect to his server using ssh. As I am a Ubuntu user, I need a key that supports the terminal command. 
So I decided it convert to .pem file. I am sharing the steps to convert PPK to Pem format on the Linux terminal using a putty gen tool.
-------------------
#Step 1 – First of all, install the putty tools on your Linux system using below command.
sudo apt-get install putty-tools
--------------------
#Step 2 – Now, convert the ppk file to pem file using puttygen command line tool.
puttygen server1.ppk -O private-openssh -o server1.pem
--------------------
#Step 3 – Change the .pem file permissions. Set the read-only permissions to the owner of the file, remove any permission to group and other. 
Otherwise ssh will refuse this key for use.
chmod 400 server1.pem
--------------------
#Step 4 – Finally, connect to your remote Linux server with ssh using this pem key.
ssh -i server1.pem ubuntu@11.22.33.44
