When trying to start the recovery process in a Standby Database, the following error message appears:

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT;
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01153: an incompatible media recovery is active

The cause of the ORA-01153 can translate into a RMAN recovery or backup session.


If we see that although a recovery session already exists but the Standby Base is not synchronizing, then we can stop the current session with the following command:

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;
 
Database altered.

Then we can run the recovery start command again and we can see that now no error message is shownhttps://github.com/YairPR/Oracle:

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT;
 
Database altered.

Now the synchronization process must continue without problems.
