“free” command output for better clarification:

$ free
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          15867        3730        9868        1189        2269       10640
Swap:         17454           0       17454
Total:        33322        3730       27322

Details are follow:

free: free is a standard command to check memory utilization in Linux.
awk: awk is a powerful command which is specialized for textual data manipulation.
FNR == 2: It gives the total number of records for each input file. Basically it’s used to select the given line (Here, it chooses the line number 2).
NR == 2: It gives the total number of records processed. Basically it’s used to filter the given line (Here, it chooses the line number 2)..
$3/$2*100: It divides column 2 with column 3 and it multiply the results with 100.
printf: It used to format and print data.
%.2f%: By default it prints floating point numbers with 6 decimal places. Use the following format to limit  decimal places.

Method-2: How to check Memory Utilization Percentage in Linux?
=======================================================================================================
We can use the following combination of commands to get this done. In this method, we are using combination of free, grep and awk command to get the memory utilization percentage.

For Memory Utilization Percentage without Percent Symbol:
 
$ free -t | grep Mem | awk '{print "Current Memory Utilization is : " $3/$2*100}'
Current Memory Utilization is : 20.4228
For Swap Utilization Percentage without Percent Symbol:

$ free -t | grep Swap | awk '{print "Current Swap Utilization is : " $3/$2*100}'
Current Swap Utilization is : 0
For Memory Utilization Percentage with Percent Symbol and two decimal places:

$ free -t | grep Mem | awk '{printf("Current Memory Utilization is : %.2f%"), $3/$2*100}'
Current Memory Utilization is : 20.43%
For Swap Utilization Percentage with Percent Symbol and two decimal places:

$ free -t | grep Swap | awk '{printf("Current Swap Utilization is : %.2f%"), $3/$2*100}'
Current Swap Utilization is : 0.00%
Method-1: How to check CPU utilization percentage in Linux?
We can use the following combination of commands to get this done. In this method, we are using combination of top, print and awk command to get the CPU utilization percentage.

If it shows multiple CPU in the output then you need to use the following method.

$ top -b -n1 | grep ^%Cpu
%Cpu0  :  5.3 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 94.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu1  :  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni,100.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu2  :  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 94.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  5.3 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu3  :  5.3 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 94.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu4  : 10.5 us, 15.8 sy,  0.0 ni, 73.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu5  :  0.0 us,  5.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 95.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu6  :  5.3 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 94.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu7  :  5.3 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 94.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
For CPU Utilization Percentage without Percent Symbol:

$ top -b -n1 | grep ^%Cpu | awk '{cpu+=$9}END{print "Current CPU Utilization is : " 100-cpu/NR}'
Current CPU Utilization is : 21.05
For CPU Utilization Percentage with Percent Symbol and two decimal places:

$ top -b -n1 | grep ^%Cpu | awk '{cpu+=$9}END{printf("Current CPU Utilization is : %.2f%"), 100-cpu/NR}'
Current CPU Utilization is : 14.81%
Method-2: How to check CPU utilization percentage in Linux?
We can use the following combination of commands to get this done. In this method, we are using combination of top, print/printf and awk command to get the CPU utilization percentage.

If it shows all together CPU(s) in the single output then you need to use the following method.

$ top -b -n1 | grep ^%Cpu
%Cpu(s): 15.3 us,  7.2 sy,  0.8 ni, 69.0 id,  6.7 wa,  0.0 hi,  1.0 si,  0.0 st
For CPU Utilization Percentage without Percent Symbol:

$ top -b -n1 | grep ^%Cpu | awk '{print "Current CPU Utilization is : " 100-$8}' 
Current CPU Utilization is : 5.6
For CPU Utilization Percentage with Percent Symbol and two decimal places:

$ top -b -n1 | grep ^%Cpu | awk '{printf("Current CPU Utilization is : %.2f%"), 100-$8}' 
Current CPU Utilization is : 5.40%
Details are follow:

top: top is one of the best command to check currently running process on Linux system.
-b: -b option, allow the top command to switch in batch mode. It is useful when you run the top command from local system to remote system.
-n1: Number-of-iterations
^%Cpu: Filter the lines which starts with %Cpu
awk: awk is a powerful command which is specialized for textual data manipulation.
cpu+=$9: For each line, add column 9 to a variable ‘cpu’.
printf: It used to format and print data.
%.2f%: By default it prints floating point numbers with 6 decimal places. Use the following format to limit a decimal places.
100-cpu/NR: Finally print the ‘CPU Average’ by subtracting 100, divided by the number of records.
