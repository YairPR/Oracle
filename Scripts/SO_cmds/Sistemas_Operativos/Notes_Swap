AIX : Swap & Paging commands

Here are some commands that helps to manage AIX paging and swapping.
List the paging space available in the system, Use lsps command.
bash-3.00# lsps -a
Page Space      Physical Volume   Volume Group    Size %Used Active  Auto  Type
hd3             hdisk0            myvolvg         4000MB  77   yes   yes    lv
You can also see the paging details in “prtconf” command.

bash-3.00# prtconf
Paging Space Information
        Total Paging Space: 3968MB
        Percent Used: 4%
Volume Groups Information
==============================================================================
myvolvg:
PV_NAME           PV STATE          TOTAL PPs   FREE PPs    FREE DISTRIBUTION
hdisk0            active            320         68          xx..00..00..00..30
==============================================================================
To add additional paging space in AIX system: Use mkps command.

bash-3.00# mkps -a -n -s 32 myvolvg
paging00
bash-3.00#
Verify the newly added paging space:

Once added, you can see the paging space in /etc/swapspaces.

bash-3.00# cat /etc/swapspaces
* /etc/swapspaces
*
* This file lists all the paging spaces that are automatically put into
* service on each system restart (the 'swapon -a' command executed from
* /etc/rc swaps on every device listed here).
*
*
* This file is modified by the chps, mkps and rmps commands and referenced
* by the lsps and swapon commands.
hd3:
        dev = /dev/hd3
paging00:
        dev = /dev/paging00
Check the status using lsps command.

bash-3.00# lsps -a
Page Space      Physical Volume   Volume Group    Size %Used Active  Auto  Type
paging00        hdisk0            myvolvg        4000MB    0   yes   yes    lv
hd3             hdisk0            myvolvg        4000MB   77   yes   yes    lv
bash-3.00#
Other commands :

You can also use “svmon” command to capture and analyze the snapshot of your AIX virtual memory system.
To check how much of paging space is used by a process, use : svmon -P pid
To print summary information on total paging space, use : swap -s
To list the status of the paging space areas in a list form, use : swap -l
