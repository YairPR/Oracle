-- For 12c and 18c 
set lin 1000
col action form a12
col version  form a40
col description form a85
col action_date form a20

select description, action, to_char(action_time,'DD/MM/RR HH24:MI:SS') action_date, ' ' version
from dba_registry_sqlpatch;

Obs.: There is no more version column, I keep that just for have compatibility with some old scripts. 


To query: 

-- 12cR1
where upper(description) like 'DATABASE PSU%'; 

-- 12cR2 onwards
where upper(descrition) like 'DATABASE RELEASE%'; 

 So, on version 11g, after apply a PSU patch on database, after run the script catbundle.sql, you can query this view with SYS account, to check information about the past PSUs applied:
   
-- 11g version 

set lin 1000
col action form a12
col version  form a40
col comments form a70
col action_date form a20

select comments, action, to_char(action_time,'DD/MM/RR HH24:MI:SS') action_date, version
from registry$history
order by action_date;

select xmltransform(dbms_qopatch.is_patch_installed('21359755'), dbms_qopatch.get_opatch_xslt) "Patch installed?" from dual;

--Using opatch lsinventory

--Get detailed info Using opatch lsinventory

--As a sysdba you can also execute below command from the sql prompt to get the patch detail.
